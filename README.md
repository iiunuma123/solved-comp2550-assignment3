This assignment assumes you all found a team of 2-3 students and an interesting research question to work on. How you decide to tackle your research question is up to you to decide, there is no given requirement. Each research question is different and can be answered in different ways.

You can answer the following assignment questions either one by one, or in the form of a coherent report where you clearly highlight which parts answer which question.

The given maximum length of answering the questions is not meant to be a guideline of how detailed you should answer the questions, but just what it says, a maximum. Your grade will not depend on the word count of your answer, but on the quality and thoughtfulness of your answers and how they reflect the effort you put into your project to find an innovative solution. Shorter answers are preferred. Feel free to include code, pictures, graphs, etc. which do not count towards the word count.  We expect more effort for 3 people teams than for 2 people teams to achieve the same marks. Your effort is expected to be within reasonable limits, and should take into account that this is only a 6-unit course and your project is only a part of this course. If one of your team members did substantially more or less than others, please report this in question 5. We may adjust the overall mark per team member if there are large differences in contribution.

<strong>Question 1:</strong> Please describe your research question. What is it, you are trying to do? Please give enough details so that any of the tutors can understand it. (Max 250 words)

<strong>Question 2 :</strong> Please motivate your research question: Why did you think this question is interesting and important? (max 500 words)

<strong>Question 3 :</strong> What is the current state of the art regarding your research question. Please give an overall summary (max 750 words, 3 marks) and describe the 2-3 (depending on the size of the team) most relevant state of the art papers in detail (max 500 words per paper, 3 marks). Please specify who summarised which paper, as the 3 marks per paper are for the person summarising it.

<strong>Question 4:</strong> Please report in detail what you have done to solve your research question in chronological order. Please describe what worked, but also what didnâ€™t work, as well as why you decided to do the steps you described. (Max 2000 words)

<strong>Question 5 :</strong> How did you distribute the work among your team? Who did what? Why did you distribute the work in that way? (Max 500 words, ideally tabular form)




<strong>Question 6 :</strong> Please describe the outcome of your research? What positive or negative results have you achieved? Please note that we do not expect positive outcomes. (Max 500 words)

<strong>Question 7 :</strong> What would be the next steps, either to answer your research question, or if answered, to extend it? (Max 500 words)

<strong>Question 8 : </strong>What have you learned from this research project? What would you do differently in hindsight? (Max 500 words)
